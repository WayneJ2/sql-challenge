# SQL-Challenge (Employee Database)

## Purpose
To take employee and company information to data engineer an employee database to then run analysis quiries on.

## Development Steps
- First an **_[Employee ERD](https://github.com/WayneJ2/sql-challenge/blob/main/Employee_ERD.PNG)_** was created to map out the creation of the Employee Database.
- Second, based on the Employee ERD, **_[Table Schemata](https://github.com/WayneJ2/sql-challenge/blob/main/Employee_sql_schemata.sql)_** was created to hold the imported data from the CSV files.
- Third, once the CSV data was imported, **_[Employee Queries](https://github.com/WayneJ2/sql-challenge/blob/main/Employee_sql_queries.sql)_** were used to gather the requested information.
- Last, **_[Bonus Employee Analysis](https://github.com/WayneJ2/sql-challenge/blob/main/SQL-Challenge_bonus.ipynb)_** was performed in Jupyter Notebook for additional requests.
